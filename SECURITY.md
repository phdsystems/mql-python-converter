# Security Best Practices Implementation

This document describes the security improvements made to the Docker configuration to follow containerization best practices.

## üîí Key Security Changes

### 1. **Non-Root User Execution**
All services now run under the `appuser` (UID: 1000, GID: 1000) instead of root:
- Supervisord runs as appuser
- All child processes inherit appuser permissions
- Wine/MT4 runs in user context
- Python services run as appuser

### 2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- **Dropped Capabilities**: Containers drop ALL Linux capabilities and only add back the minimum required
- **No New Privileges**: Prevents privilege escalation
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### 3. **File System Security**
- Named volumes instead of bind mounts where possible
- Read-only mounts for source code in production
- Proper file ownership (appuser:appuser)
- Temporary files in /tmp with user permissions

## üìã Configuration Files

### Secure Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.secure`)
- Creates non-root user `appuser` with UID/GID 1000
- Sets proper ownership for all directories
- Runs final CMD as appuser
- No unnecessary sudo permissions in production

### Secure Supervisord (`supervisord-secure.conf`)
- All programs run with `user=appuser`
- Socket file in /tmp with restricted permissions
- PID file in /tmp (writable by appuser)
- Proper HOME and USER environment variables

### Secure Docker Compose (`docker-compose.secure.yml`)
- Explicit user specification: `user: "1000:1000"`
- Security options: `no-new-privileges:true`
- Dropped all capabilities, only add required ones
- Resource limits (CPU and memory)
- Health checks for monitoring
- Network isolation with custom subnet

## üöÄ Usage

### Development Environment
```bash
# Build and run secure containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up -d

# Check container user
docker exec mt4-converter-secure whoami
# Output: appuser

# Verify services
docker exec mt4-converter-secure ps aux | grep -E "xvfb|vnc|python"
```

### Production Environment
Additional recommendations for production:
1. Remove source code bind mounts
2. Set `read_only: true` where possible
3. Use secrets management for passwords
4. Enable AppArmor or SELinux profiles
5. Scan images for vulnerabilities
6. Sign images with Docker Content Trust

## üîç Security Verification

### Check Running User
```bash
# Verify all processes run as appuser
docker exec mt4-converter-secure ps aux | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
```

### Check Capabilities
```bash
# View dropped capabilities
docker inspect mt4-converter-secure | grep -A 10 CapDrop
```

### Resource Usage
```bash
# Monitor resource limits
docker stats mt4-converter-secure
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Benefits of Non-Root Execution

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: If container is compromised, attacker has limited privileges
2. **Compliance**: Meets security standards (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS)
3. **Defense in Depth**: Additional layer of security
4. **Audit Trail**: Better tracking of user actions
5. **Isolation**: Process isolation between services

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Notes

When migrating from root-based containers:
1. Ensure all volumes have correct ownership: `chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/volume`
2. Update any hardcoded paths that assume root access
3. Test all functionality with non-root user
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to use secure images

## üîê Additional Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- Never hardcode passwords (use Docker secrets or external config)
- VNC_PASSWORD should be changed from default
- Use environment-specific configurations

### Network Security
- Custom bridge network with defined subnet
- Service-to-service communication only
- Expose only necessary ports
- Consider using reverse proxy for web access

### Image Security
```bash
# Scan image for vulnerabilities
docker scan mt4-converter-secure

# Verify image signature (if using DCT)
docker trust inspect --pretty <image>
```
